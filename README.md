# Unskew the League

The goal of this project is to offer NBA league-wide rankings that have been adjusted to reflect the differences in conference difficulty. This project was inspired by the March 8, 2024 episode of the [Greatest Of All Talk](https://greatestofalltalk.com) podcast. Checkout the site at [UnskewTheLeague.com](https://unskewtheleague.com)
